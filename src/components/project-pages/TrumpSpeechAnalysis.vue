                            <p>
                                There have been concerns that nationalist, right-wing sentiments have gained momentum over the years of the Trump presidency. 
                                Our group wanted to investigate how Donald Trumpâ€™s rhetoric may have influenced public sentiment on a regional level. 
                                To this end, we analyzed Trump's campaign speeches and the tweets by locals from 4 cities he visited on his campaign and Florida,
                                a swing state.

                            <p> 
                                Trump's positive sentiment words tend to be adjectives with "great" far exceeding the rest. Among words with negative sentiment, 
                                there are more meaningful words related to his speech topics such as "investigation", "defense", "deficit", & "press".

                            <p> 
                                In Trump's speeches across the entire campaign, his most frequent words, normalized on Romney's campaign speeches, include
                                "Hillary", "don't" "great", "deal", as well as words related to his election platform such as "border", "wall", "Mexico", "ISIS", "trade", 
                                and "China". Words used to thwart Hillary Clinton's campaign such as "Hillary", "email", "lies", "corrupt", "crook", and "FBI" in regards to Clinton's email scandal 
                                appear more frequently in Trump's Florida campaign speeches than across all of his campaign speeches, showing that in swing states, 
                                Trump strategizes to mention the scandal more frequently to win voters to tip the scale.
