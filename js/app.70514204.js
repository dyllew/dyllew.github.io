We devised the Flood Presence image classification task, constructed Train/Dev/Test splits, and annotated images from FC. We report a weighted F1 score of 92.1% on the test split and 82.5% on the FC images. Using the results of our image analysis ML methodology and the insights we gained from crisis managers, we iterated on the design of our text analysis ML methodology. This led to the creation of the Human Risk text classification task which is tailored to a subset of the identified information needs of the crisis managers. To align with the priorities of crisis managers for this task, we determined the model evaluation metric to be the F2 score.

This dataset provides the ability to compare the TV networks over time on the subject of climate change in order to answer the research question we have previously posed. We followed standard Natural Language Processing (NLP) text preprocessing by removing punctuation and numbers, converting all letters to lower-case (the data was already provided as lowercase), lemmatizing, removing standard English stopwords & corpus-specific stopwords, and tokenizing the data into words. We conducted our analysis with two distinct analysis streams: Frequency Analysis and Content Analysis. Our Frequency Analysis entailed methods of time-series analysis of climate change mentions by the different TV networks over time and dynamic time-warping & STL decomposition. Content Analysis used methods of TF-IDF document embeddings, Cosine Similarity as a proxy for content similarity between documents, and Topic Modeling & Change-Point Detection. The above figure was created as part of an exploratory component of the TF-IDF Embedding analysis, in which we wished to extract the most important words to each of the networks across the entire corpus.

To conduct our content analysis, we needed to featurize the news snippets, or collections of snippets, which form the documents in our corpus. I first formed a document for each TV network in our dataset (e.g. all snippets for CNN), and transformed the documents into a L2-normalized unit vector TF-IDF vector embedding. From this featurization, I formed a document-term matrix, where the rows correspond to the TF-IDF embedding of a document and the column represents a unique word in the corpus (~34k words). Thus, entry i, j corresponds to the normalized TF-IDF score of word j in document i (i.e. word j's relative importance for the ith document). I also constructed document-term matrices for documents representing each year of our dataset (e.g. all snippets in 2009) as well as for documents constructed from networks in specific years (e.g. all CNN snippets in 2015). Finally, for each of the document-term matrices mentioned above, I calculated the pairwise cosine similarity between the document embeddings to yield a measure of content similarity between the documents. A heatmap constructed from the computed cosine similarities between the network in each year documents is shown above.
