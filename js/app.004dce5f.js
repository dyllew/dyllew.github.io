To conduct our content analysis, we needed to featurize the news snippets, or collections of snippets, which form the documents in our corpus. I first formed a document for each TV network in our dataset (e.g. all snippets for CNN), and transformed the documents into a L2-normalized unit vector TF-IDF vector embedding. From this featurization, I formed a document-term matrix, where the rows correspond to the TF-IDF embedding of a document and the column represents a unique word in the corpus (~34,000 words). Thus, entry i, j corresponds to the normalized TF-IDF score of word j in document i (i.e. word j's relative importance for the ith document). I also constructed document-term matrices for documents representing each year of our dataset (e.g. all snippets in 2009) as well as for documents constructed from networks in specific years (e.g. all CNN snippets in 2015). Finally, for each of the document-term matrices mentioned above, I calculated the pairwise cosine similarity between the document embeddings to yield a measure of content similarity between the documents. A heatmap constructed from the computed cosine similarities between the network & year documents is shown above. The main findings from my analysis were that the content of climate mentions in the latter years of the dataset, 2016-2020, are most dissimilar to earlier years in the dataset, 2009-2012.

This similarly occurred for CNN in 2012 & 2013.
