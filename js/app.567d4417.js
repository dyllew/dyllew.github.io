From this featurization, I formed a document-term matrix, where the rows correspond to the TF-IDF embedding of a document and the column represents a unique word in the corpus (~34,000 words). Thus, entry i, j corresponds to the normalized TF-IDF score of word j in document i (i.e. word j's relative importance for the ith document).

Finally, for each of the document-term matrices mentioned above, I calculated the pairwise cosine similarity between the document embeddings to yield a measure of content similarity between the documents.
