We cooperated with crisis managers in Fukuchiyama City (FC), a city in Japan which is susceptible to flood events, and analyzed crowdsourced crisis image and text data from past FC flood events. We devised the Flood Presence image classification task, constructed Train/Dev/Test splits, and annotated images from FC. We report a weighted F1 score of 92.1% on the test split and 82.5% on the FC images. Using the results of our image analysis ML methodology and the insights we gained from crisis managers, we iterated on the design of our text analysis ML methodology. This led to the creation of the Human Risk text classification task which is tailored to a subset of the identified information needs of the crisis managers. To align with the priorities of crisis managers for this task, we determined the model evaluation metric to be the F2 score.

From this featurization, I formed a document-term matrix, where the rows correspond to the TF-IDF embedding of a document and the column represents a unique word in the corpus (~34,000 words). Thus, entry i, j corresponds to the normalized TF-IDF score of word j in document i (i.e. word j's relative importance for the ith document).

Finally, for each of the document-term matrices mentioned above, I calculated the pairwise cosine similarity between the document embeddings to yield a measure of content similarity between the documents.
