We conducted our analysis with two distinct analysis streams: Frequency Analysis and Content Analysis. Our Frequency Analysis entailed methods of time-series analysis of climate change mentions by the different TV networks over time and dynamic time-warping & STL decomposition. Content Analysis used methods of TF-IDF document embeddings, Cosine Similarity as a proxy for content similarity between documents, and Topic Modeling & Change-Point Detection.

To conduct our content analysis, we needed to featurize the news snippets, or collections of snippets, which form the documents in our corpus. I first formed a document for each TV network in our dataset (e.g. all snippets for CNN), and transformed the documents into a L2-normalized unit vector TF-IDF vector embedding. From this featurization, I formed a document-term matrix, where the rows correspond to the TF-IDF embedding of a document and the column represents a unique word in the corpus (~34,000 words). Thus, entry i, j corresponds to the normalized TF-IDF score of word j in document i (i.e. word j's relative importance for the ith document). I also constructed document-term matrices for documents representing each year of our dataset (e.g. all snippets in 2009) as well as for documents constructed from networks in specific years (e.g. all CNN snippets in 2015). Finally, for each of the document-term matrices mentioned above, I calculated the pairwise cosine similarity between the document embeddings to yield a measure of content similarity between the documents. A heatmap constructed from the computed cosine similarities between the network & year documents is shown above. The main findings from my analysis were that the content of climate mentions in the latter years of the dataset, 2016-2020, are most dissimilar to earlier years in the dataset, 2009-2012. Additionally, in the years 2010 & 2018, the content of MSNBC differed greatly from the other news networks in those years and with other networks and itself in other years. This similarly occurred for CNN in 2012 & 2013. Lastly, with the exception of these years, the similarity of content of climate mentions between CNN and MSNBC, the liberal-leaning networks, has been increasing over the years, although the pairwise content similarity between all of the networks is fairly high over time.

This is reflected in the content of the climate mentions over time as words describing the political events occurring at the time tend to be the most important words for each of the networks in that specific year coupled with the tendency of different networks in the same year to have high content similarity.
