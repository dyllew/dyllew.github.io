This aim is made difficult because of the plethora of information being published each year, and the nature of the research corpus as unstructured text or grey literature. To make informed decisions and understand the growing corpus of research available, researchers have turned to evidence synthesis - the process of compiling information and knowledge from many sources and disciplines to inform decisions. However, the manual evidence synthesis process takes extensive time (often 18 months to 3 years) and effort, and may soon be impossible at the world’s increasing rate of research output. To address these problems, we employ natural language processing techniques on a international development literature corpus of 244 documents to extract information from the title and abstract of international development documents, and to automatically cluster documents based on their content. We classify documents by Country of Study using a pretrained transformer Named Entity Recognition model and achieve an accuracy of 91.0%.

From this featurization, I formed a document-term matrix, where the rows correspond to the TF-IDF embedding of a document and the column represents a unique word in the corpus (~34,000 words). Thus, entry i, j corresponds to the normalized TF-IDF score of word j in document i (i.e. word j's relative importance for the ith document).

Finally, for each of the document-term matrices mentioned above, I calculated the pairwise cosine similarity between the document embeddings to yield a measure of content similarity between the documents.
