# Dylan's Personal Portfolio Website

Hey! Thank you for coming to my portfolio website repo.

I wrote the site in Vue.js & Bootstrap. I wanted to build this website as my first personal project & to showcase projects/artwork I've completed. I also wanted to get more experience using Vue.js & Bootstrap, more specifically to get experience building a website that's built for mobile & desktop viewing.
